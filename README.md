## Documentation

*	[Mollie iDEAL API](https://www.mollie.nl/support/documentatie/betaaldiensten/ideal/)

## Development environment

If you want to test Mollie iDEAL on a development environment wich is not 
accessible for Mollie you might get the following error:

> -3 A fetch was issued without (proper) specification of 'reporturl'

To fix this issue you can override the Mollie 'reporturl' parameter by 
the following configuration constant:

```
define( 'MOLLIE_IDEAL_REPORT_URL', 'http://www.example.com/' );
```

You can put this in your WordPress configuration file and you should be good
to go.
